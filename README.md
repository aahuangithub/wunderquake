# Results
Out of 124 earthquake days, 57 were hotter than usual for that day.    
Keep in mind that I only analyzed earthquakes from Jan 1979 to March 2018.     
Weather data may be missing from some earthquake days. For the day to be considered "hot" I gave the day a 3 degree fahrenheit difference.
